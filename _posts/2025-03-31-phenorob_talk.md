Doing a PhD is kind of like signing up for a marathon without fully knowing the route. Well, in the beginning you have a route or at least a one pager drawing of it, often in the form of the orginal proposal. However, in most cases thing to not follow up these nicely paved ways that you thought lay ahead. There are highs, lows, unexpected detours, and a lot of snacks in between. 

I recently got the chance to share my outcomes in an online PhenoRob graduate talk. It was a version of my PhD defense, but with less pressure and more room to zoom out a bit. I talked about how plant root systems react to changes in their environment, and how we can actually measure and model all that complexity using a mix of fieldwork, imaging, and simulations. Basically, trying to make sense of whatâ€™s happening underground (in terms of under the soil surface, not in the hood).

Looking back, my PhD was intense but also incredibly rewarding. There were long field days, code that refused to cooperate, and more failed experiments than I care to count. But also those great moments when things finally clicked.

What made this talk special for me was being able to reflect on the whole journey, not just the science. Sharing the ups, the downs, and the weird little in-betweens was a great way to wrap things up.
