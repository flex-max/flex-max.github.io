It is not every day that your research ends up in a magazin, so today I am really excited that our project ReGenFarm was recently featured in a highlight article about the intersection of modern farming and science in the magazin [*Endeavours*](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/innovation/service/erfolgsgeschichten/endeavours/2025).

Together with Bernd Olligs, a sixth-generation farmer who is constantly pushing the limits of what is possible on his land, we have been working on a digital twin of his farm using the agro-ecosystem model AgroC. From soil data to crop rotations to carbon dynamics. The idea is to simulate what is happening in the field and to test how different management strategies might play out in the future, especially under changing climate conditions.

The article captures this collaboration really well. Science not as a set of instructions, but as a sparring partner: helping to fine-tune ideas, back them up with data, and make better decisions for the long term.

I am genuinely happy to see the work featured, and even more so to be part of a project that shows how forward-thinking agriculture and research can go hand in hand. We’re looking forward to the next steps and excited to keep growing this partnership.
