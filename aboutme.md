### My academic way

My path in plant science started with a Bachelor’s degree in Agronomy, where I got my first real hands-on experience with soil, crops, and everything that makes agriculture tick. Wanting to dive deeper, I continued with a Master’s in Crop Science, focusing on crop growth, ecosystems, and how we can use technology to make farming more sustainable.

For my Ph.D., I explored how plants interact with their environment, using phenotyping and modeling to better understand these complex systems. 

Now, as a postdoc I’m working on research that connects plant science, soil science, environmental sustainability, and digital agriculture.
