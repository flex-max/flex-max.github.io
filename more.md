# Ad hoc referee

Since 2022, I have served as a reviewer for several high-impact journals. My primary focus is on non-profit and community-driven journals. I have contributed as a referee for:

- Annals of Botany
- AoB Plants
- Journal of Experimental Botany
- New Phytologist
- Plant and Soil
- Plant Methods
- Plant Phenomics
- Rhizosphere
- Scientific Reports
- The Plant Phenome Journal
