## My Motivation

Across the globe, agriculture is facing increasingly extreme environmental challenges, driven by the growing impacts of climate change, reducing water and nutrient availability for many agricultural systems.  

My motivation is to understand how key crops can adapt in order to maintain - or even restore - food security. I also focus on larger-scale agricultural processes with regards to carbon cycling in order to improve carbon sequestration and soil health.
