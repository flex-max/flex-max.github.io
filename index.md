**Across the globe, agriculture is facing increasingly extreme environmental challenges, driven by the growing impacts of climate change.**

**My motivation is to understand how key crops can adapt to these changes in order to maintain - or even restore - food security. I also focus on larger-scale agricultural processes with regards to carbon cycling in order to improve carbon sequestration and soil health.**

Currently I'm working as post-doc at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences: Agrosphere (IBG-3), Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, Germany.
