<strong>Across the globe, agriculture is facing increasingly extreme environmental challenges, driven by the growing impacts of climate change.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>My motivation is to understand how key crops can adapt to these changes in order to maintain - or even restore - food security. I also focus on larger-scale agricultural processes with regards to carbon cycling in order to improve carbon sequestration and soil health.</strong>
