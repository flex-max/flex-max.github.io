The 16th of December. I was nervous — no, let’s be honest, I was terrified. The kind of nerves that make you forget how to hold a pen, let alone articulate scientific arguments. But there I was, dressed in what I hoped was a convincing mix of professionalism and quiet confidence (represented by the optimistic colors grey and black), about to face five seasoned professors, each an expert in a different corner of plant science, under the eyes of colleagures, freinds and family. 

The clock started ticking. I was talking. Half an hour later my defense presntation was done. 20 min more of question and then ... Oral exam. 

Althought it was the deepest winter, questions rained down like an unexpected summer storm—some refreshing, some thunderous, all demanding sharp, composed answers. I felt like a plant under drought stress, searching for reserves of knowledge to keep me alive. The question were like the roots I investigated during my studies: One branched into another, each probing deeper, challenging my understanding, my interpretations, and—perhaps at some point most terrifyingly—my ability to say "I don’t know" without paniking. 

At the end, minutes stretched into what felt like decades, yet somehow, an hour and a 21 minutes passed. Almost the maximum duration, no mercy. Then, the moment of suspense: I was asked to step outside while the professors deliberated. A strange silence followed, now minutes strechted into geological ages.

And then — relief. Smiles. Handshakes. Congratulations. The verdict? *Summa cum laude*. 

But before I could fully process the magnitude of it all, someone handed me a glass of champagne. And in that sparkling moment, I realized: It was over. I had made it.

Although this may read a bit dramatic, of course, this journey wasn’t one I walked alone. A PhD might feel like an individual battle, but behind every researcher stands an army of support. To my advisors, Andrea Schnepf and Guillaume Lobet, who challenged and guided me, thank you for pushing me beyond my limits. To my colleagues, who shared in the struggles, the long nights, and the occasional scientific despair, thank you for your camaraderie and coffee. To my friends and family, who endured my endless rants about plants, data, and academic bureaucracy — your support is legendary. 

And finally, a quiet thank you to myself — for showing up, pushing through, and never giving up, no matter what.
